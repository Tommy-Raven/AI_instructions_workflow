# sswg_skelton
The sswg (minimum viable model) a meta-educational AI system for generating, evaluating, and evolving AI and Human-formatted instructional workflows.

#SSWG Skeleton Repository

##Synthetic Synthesist of Workflow Generation (SSWG)

This repository serves as the canonical skeleton for the SSWG MVM. It defines the immutable base structure and placeholder modules for building modular, recursive AI instructional workflows.

#Repository Structure

generator/      # Core MVM workflow generator logic
cli/            # Command-line interface for workflow execution and governance
pdl/            # Phase Definition Language (PDL) files defining workflow phases
artifacts/      # Additive-only generated artifacts
docs/           # Documentation and usage guides


---

##Purpose

Provide a stable, immutable base for SSWG workflows.

Enable branch/fork governance for all edits beyond canonical modules.

Define modular phase execution scaffolds for PDL-based AI workflows.

Serve as a reference structure for all SSWG MVM operations and rebuilds.



---

##Getting Started

1. Clone the canonical skeleton:
git clone https://github.com/Tommy-Raven/sswg_skelton.git


2. Explore the folder structure and placeholder modules.


3. Use this repository as the base for:

Rebuild operations in sswg_MVM

Additive artifact creation

Phase-based PDL execution





---

##Notes

Do not modify the canonical branch directly. Use branches/forks for any updates or experimental work.

Core modules (e.g., generator/main.py, cli/cli.py) are placeholders and will be implemented in subsequent steps.

PDL files in pdl/ define the workflow phases and metadata rules for SSWG.
